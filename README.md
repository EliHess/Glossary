Repository to collect important concepts

**Random forest**: A machine learning algorithm for classification, regression and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees (during training) to generate a single result.

**Data dimensionality**: Dimensionality of data refers to the number of properties or categories in a dataset

**Regression Analysis**: Statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

**Black box**: The inability to undestand how a deep learning system makes its decisions.

**Deep Learning**: neural networks with multiple layers, allowing complex patterns and representations to be learned from large datasets.

**Signal** The part of the data you want to study/explore. Datasets must sometimes be denoised in order to pull out what you want.

**Local model interpretation:** set of techniques aimed at evaluating why a model makes a specific prediction and what effect a specific feature value has on the prediction. 

**Data Mining:** Analyzing raw data to extract useful information and find patterns.

**Structured Data**: data organized in a specific format, such as position (lat, long) information or physical measurements.
